# SUMMARY
In this project I tackled the everlasting discourse of gun violence and gun control. I found this data set on Kaggle and was immediately intrigued as I wanted to see if there was any evidence of an increase of incidents in the past couple of decades and any other interesting factors.

# OVERVIEW
To begin, I imported the data into a jupyter notebook in order to analyze and clean it up. The first thing I noticed right away was the total victims column had an error on the first row. This could've been the only row that was incorrect but in order to ensure all the data was accurate I deleted the total column and created one from scratch by adding the fatalities and injured columns together. I also dropped some columns as some of them were not relevant or did not have sufficient data to be of use and renamed a couple to give a more fitting name.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

- What is the average age of the shooters?
- Have we noticed an increase in cases over the last couple of decades?
- Is the shooter typically male or female?
- What type of location falls victim to a shooting more often?
- Which case has had the most victims?

Below is the dashboard I created from the dataset and research questions. I chose these specific graphs and theme to highlight the horrible tragic losses of all the events.
